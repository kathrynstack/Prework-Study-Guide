## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going throughthe Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

My motivation for creating this study guide was to create a knowledge base for the information I will be learning throughout the Coding Bootcamp. 
I built this project so moving forward I will be able to reference this study guide and excel in the Coding Bootcamp program, as well in my Coding career.
This study guide solved the problem of not having a centralized location for all of the new information I will be learning in the Coding Boootcamp. 
I learned how to utilize Github, VS code, and an introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
